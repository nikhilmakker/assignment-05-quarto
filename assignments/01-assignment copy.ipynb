Therefore, the CPU is often waiting for data because it processes at a faster rate compared to the RAM transferring memory."

Abstraction makes image data analyzable by converting  images into structured numerical data, anddetermines the balance between detail and meaning. This directly affects a model's ability to make accurate predictions on these images."
